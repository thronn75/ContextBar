# ContextDock

ContextDock is a context-aware Dock extension for macOS that adapts to your workflow.

When you code, it shows your development tools.  
When you design, it switches to creative apps.  
When you write, it focuses on documentation and research.

No clutter. No manual switching. Just the right tools at the right time.
